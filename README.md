# ResNet-ResNeXt-DenseNet
TensorFlow Implementation of the ResNet, ResNeXt, DenseNet


# Introduction

Here we implement multiple neural network architectures and comparing them on various criterion like number of parameters, train and test set accuracies and provide detailed analysis of why one architecture works better than another one.


# Dataset

CIFAR-10 is a dataset consisting of 60000, 32Ã—32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. More details about the datset can be found [here](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

Sample images from each class of the CIFAR-10 dataset is shown below:

A randomized version of the CIFAR-10 dataset with 50000 training images and 10000 test images can be downloaded from [here](). CIFAR10 has two subfolders Train and Test for training and testing images respectively stored in .png format for ease of viewing and loading. Please replace these subfolders in the CIFAR10 folder and put it in the project directory.
